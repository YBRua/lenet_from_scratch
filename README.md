# lenet_from_scratch
AI004 人工智能问题求解与实践期末大作业。

My final project for course AI004 Artificial Intelligence Problem Solving and Practice.


部分代码是助教写的模板。

Part of this code was written by the TA as the template.


这是一个类似LeNet-5的神经网络，网络主干部分只使用了Numpy库。

因为写这个大作业的时候我对Numpy或者神经网络编程都没什么概念，所以这是参考了很多人写的代码之后的缝合怪。

我不知道这样合不合法（、

如果有不妥当的地方请联系我，我会直接爆破掉这个仓库（

This is a Convolution Neural Network that resembles LeNet-5, implemented from scratch basically using numpy only.

Since I hardly knew anything about Python, numpy or AI programming when I was trying to finish this final project, I read other people's code for reference.
